print('''We'll be learning about numpy,it stands for Numerical python ,
 it uses array instead of python lists
but is slow to process
Numpy uses arrays which are 50x faster than array
array object is ===== ndarray
ndarray stores in the contagious memeory locations, so it is fast
it is called Locality of Reference
it is also optimised to cpu architecture
