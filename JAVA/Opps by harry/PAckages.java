// what is the difference between compiler and the interpreter
// interpreter will translate one sentence at a time.
// compiler will scan the whole program and will change the whole program into machine code
// machine code of windows, linux and mac will be different
// javaScript and python uses interpreter which is easy to use for programmer bcz if any error occurs and then it will only show error at that line , but if we use compiler than the whole program will not run just bcz of one wrong line
// compiled languages will be fast than interpreted languages
// java is compiled and interpreted language
/// java is hybrid language
// java has made hybrid language just to make it platform independent language



//            compiled
// file.java -----------------> file.class------------------>can be used by the interpreter
//            using javac      byte code 



// file.class ka byte code platform independant hai and it will work on all machines
// now any JVM( java virtual machine ) will interpret the byte code
