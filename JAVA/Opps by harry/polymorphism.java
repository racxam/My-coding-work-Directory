// Smart phone inherits cell phone class--- inheritance
// Samrt phone implements GPS interface --- interface implements
// Samrt phone implements Camera interface--- interface implements
// Samrt phone implements Media Player interface--- interface implements


// it simple means smart phone is a cell phone which can act like a GPS, Camera and media player, 
// This quality of smart phone working as GPS , camera and media player is called polymorphism

//GPS g= new Smart phone();-- only GPS methods will work
