//static var
//1. local variable- whose accesbility is local
// 2. global var- they defined outside of main and they are accessible throught the program
// 3. global and local have if same name then local will win over precedence
//4. staic var- its important
// they are automatically initilised to 0 if not explitally init.
// they remain throught the program
// in c static var can only be initlised using const literals
// like static int a=3;
// static var always preserve there values when called out of scope
// they preserve their value from the previous scope and can't initlised again
// static var same rahta hai after closing the funciton
