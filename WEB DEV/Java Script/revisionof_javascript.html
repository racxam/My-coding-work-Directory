<!-- 
we always write JS at the end or just above the ending </body> tag 
there are two ways of writing JS  
1. inline using<script> tag</script>
2. we can  also add a JS file and link it -->


<!-- Some important points we should know -->
<!-- 1.we can use "differ" attribut in JS if we wants to write it above and it only for external css

2.If you wants to load JS in sync with DOM loading Then Use "async" attribute

3. "differ mein JS ki ext file ka order matter karta hai"

4. "async mein JS ki ext file ka order matter nahi karta"

 <!-- JAVA SCRIPT is a Case sensitive language -->
 <!-- we use semi-colon here in multi-line statements -->


 <!-- Style of writing Comments
 1. //-----single line commment
 2. /* ....*/ multi-line Comments
 same like c++ -->

<!-- Java Script is a dynamically typed language here we don't define data type engine automatically know the data type -->
<!-- means ye value ke hisab se smjh sakta hai  -->

<!-- 
There are two types of DATA TYPES
1.Primitive 
2.User-Defined or non-primitive -->

<!-- 1. Primitive
i. Boolean -- two values true of false
ii.undefined-- var sumit; having no value right now
iii.Number-- integer or float or double
iv.String -- array of words
v.Null-- var aman= null; we are saying that plz don't put any value to variable aman
vi.symbol not yet in our sylabbus--> 

<!-- 2. User-Defined 
i. objects
ii. functions -->


<!-- how do i write objects -->
<!-- null data type is also a type of object -->

<!-- if you wants to write a big number then its called BIG INT and write"n" in the end of the no like 4534525352525452n; -->
<!-- 
if you wants to write at console then use 
console.log("what you wants to get printed"); -->

<!-- if you wants to know the type of data then use console and type of like this -->
<!-- var num=347938040450n;

console.log(typeof num);
it will give BigInt as typof num on console -->

<!-- variables -->
<!-- there are three ways to declare a variable -->
<!-- let const var -->
<!-- using let like
    //declaring a variable
let myname; // this is a undefined data type

// initlizing a variable
myname= 45;// this is of number data type


-->


<!-- Normally we use three naming conventions -->
<!-- 
1.camelCase
2.PascalCase
3.snake_case 
-->

<!-- we can use CONST keyword to make constant varible whose values we don't wants to change in future usually we write Their name in UPPERCASE letters -->
<!-- like const PRICE=99; -->


<!-- how do i take input from user -->
<!-- use prompt -->
<!-- var modeOfPayment;
modeOfPayment=promt("what is the pay mode?"); -->
<!-- output to user -->
<!-- alert("modeOfPayment is"+ modeOfPayment); -->
